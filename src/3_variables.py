"""
Python is dynamically typed language ( and it's awesome :D )
It means thay you don't have the specify the type of your variables.
** Python is case-sensitive
Let's see the example:

"""

# These are python built-in data types, we will focus on each of them in next examples.

# String
str_var = "I am a string."

# Boolean
bool_var = True  # or False

# Integer
int_var = 13

# Float
float_var = 9.34

# Complex number
complex_var = 1 + 2j

# List
list_var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuple
tuple_var = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Dictionary
dict_var = {"name": "Ashkan", "age": 26}

# set
set_var = {"Python", "GoLang", "C++"}
