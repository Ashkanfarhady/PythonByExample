In this repo, you can find simple examples to teach you to code in python language.
<br>
The original idea is from [GoByExample](https://gobyexample.com/)<br>
We used python3 in our examples <br>
The examples are step-by-step, and if you are a complete-beginner, followe the order. <br>
This repo is not ready at all (WIP) <br>
